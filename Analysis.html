<h1>The Scenario</h1>
<div>

  <div>
    <p>
      New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities with almost 20 million people in its metropolitan
      statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area.
      The city has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing
      commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports, and is the
      most photographed city in the world. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important
      center for international diplomacy,and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City
      Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. Other features of the
      city's transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587 yellow taxicabs, other vehicle for hire companies,
      and the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and
      Manhattan Island.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>
  The yellow taxicab is an iconic vehicle related to the city of New York. The <b>NYC Taxi Trips</b> database provides
  4 million rows* of data between the years of 2009 and 2012 in this city alone, which accounts for over 1.6GB of
  data for processing and analysis!
</p>

<p>
  The following questions were proposed to guide this data analysis exercise. For instructions on how the
  processing of data was conducted and what tools were used, see the <b>README.md</b> file.
</p>

<p class="remark">
  *The number is a quick result from the query <code>select count(*) from trips;</code>
</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
For all the queries, the database is loaded with data from the years 2009-2012

<h2>1. What is the average distance traveled by trips with a maximum of 2 passengers?</h2>
<p>
  The query below results in an average distance of 2.66 miles.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
  select avg(trip_distance) from trips
  where passenger_count <= 2;
</code>
</pre>


<h2>2. Which are the 3 biggest vendors based on the total amount of money raised?</h2>
<div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The next table is the direct result of the query below. As calculated, Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC is the
      largest vendor, with a total revenue of over $19.5 million in the 4-year period; followed closely by Verifone
      Inc, also above $19 million. The third largest vendor is Dependable Driver Service, Inc, with a revenue
      of just over $2.7 million, more than 6 times smaller than the second place.
    </p>
<pre>
<code>
  select vendors.name as Vendor, sum(total_amount) as Total from trips
  join vendors on trips.vendor_id=vendors.vendor_id
  group by Vendor
  order by total desc
  limit 3;
</code>
</pre>
  </div>
  <div class="table-box">
    <table>
      <caption>Largest taxi vendors by revenue (2009-2012)</caption>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Position</b></td>
        <td><b>Vendor</b></td>
        <td><b>Total Revenue</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC</td>
        <td>$19,549,084.27</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>VeriFone Inc</td>
        <td>$19,043,434.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td>Dependable Driver Service, Inc</td>
        <td>$2,714,901.72</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<h2>3. Make a histogram of the monthly distribution over 4 years of rides paid with cash</h2>
<p>
  The two queries below are combined in histogram between rides paid with cash and rides paid by other methods. Note
  that there is data missing for some months, namely November 2011, November 2012 and December 2012.
</p>
<p>
  Visual inspection shows that the ratio between cash/not cash rides is steady along the whole period, and that there
  are drops in the overall number of rides around the end of the year, with the minimums recorded in December 2009
  and December 2010.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
  select count(*) as Cash_Only, Datepart(Month,pickup_datetime) as Month, Datepart(Year, pickup_datetime) as Year from trips
  join payment on payment.payment_type=trips.payment_type
  where payment_lookup = 'Cash'
  group by Month, Year
  order by Year, Month;

  select count(*) as Not_Cash, Datepart(Month,pickup_datetime) as Month, Datepart(Year, pickup_datetime) as Year from trips
  join payment on payment.payment_type=trips.payment_type
  where payment_lookup != 'Cash'
  group by Month, Year
  order by Year, Month;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>4. Make a time series chart computing the number of tips each day for the last 3 months of 2012</h2>
<p>
  Two queries are presented to get the time series from the database, the difference being that the first uses the
  day of the year as an integer index for the data, while the second query results in a multi-level index of the pair
  (Day, Month). The indexing style of the first query is used for the image below.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
  select count(*) as Tips, Datepart(dayofyear, pickup_datetime) as Date from trips
  where tip_amount > 0
  and Datepart(Year,pickup_datetime) = 2012 and Datepart(Month,pickup_datetime) between 10 and 12
  group by Date
  order by Date;

  select count(*) as Tips, Datepart(Day,pickup_datetime) as Day, Datepart(Month, pickup_datetime) as Month from trips
  where tip_amount > 0
  and Datepart(Year,pickup_datetime) = 2012 and Datepart(Month,pickup_datetime) between 10 and 12
  group by Day, Month
  order by Month, Day;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>5. What is the average trip time on Saturdays and Sundays?</h2>

<p>
  The next query results in the average duration of 524 seconds (or 8 minutes and 44 seconds) for the trips in the
  weekends of the whole period. For the calculation it was assumed that the valid trips started between 00:00:00 on the
  Saturday and 23:59:59 on the Sunday.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
  select avg(datediff(seconds, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime)) as Average_sec from trips
  where date_part(weekday, pickup_datetime) in (6, 0);
</code>
</pre>
